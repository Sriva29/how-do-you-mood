 ## Environment Setup

To run this project locally, you'll need to set up your environment variables:

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual environment variable values. For instance, you'll need to obtain an OpenAI API key and set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to that value.
